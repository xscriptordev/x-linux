# Project Structure

This document describes the repository composition and the role of key files and directories.

## `airootfs/` Composition

`airootfs/` is the most important directory in the project. Its content is overlaid into the target filesystem during image/rootfs builds.

- `airootfs/etc/`: system-level configuration and branding.
- `airootfs/root/`: automation scripts and Archinstall-related files.
- `airootfs/usr/local/bin/`: helper scripts available in the live environment.
- `airootfs/usr/local/share/`: branding assets (wallpapers, images, sound templates).

## Build-Critical Files

- `profiledef.sh`: defines ISO metadata, boot modes, image behavior, and selected file permissions.
- `packages.x86_64`: package list used by build scripts.
- `pacman.conf`: repository configuration used by both ISO and WSL build flows.

## Build Outputs

- ISO flow (`xbuild.sh`) writes artifacts to `out/`.
- WSL flow (`xbuildwsl.sh` and `xbuildwslc.sh`) writes artifacts to `out-wsl/`.
- Temporary build work directories are `work/` and `work-wsl/`.
